# Homework 1: FIN-407 (Machine Learning in Finance)

Welcome to Homework 1 of FIN-407! This assignment is designed to help you get comfortable with Python programming, NumPy, and Pandas, all of which are essential tools in Machine Learning for Finance.

## Overview

This repository contains three Python files: `task1.py`, `task2.py`, and `task3.py`. Each file presents a different challenge related to Python and its libraries. Your job is to complete the missing parts of the code marked with `# TODO`. This assignment will test your understanding of basic Python functionalities, NumPy operations, and data manipulation using Pandas.

## Tasks

### Task 1:  Implementing a Custom List (`task1.py`)

In this task, you will implement a custom list class called CustomList, mimicking some of the behavior of Python's built-in list. You will work with dunder (magic) methods to enable operations like indexing, length retrieval, and string representation.

* Implement methods for appending, removing, and accessing elements.
* Define dunder methods to support operations like addition and length retrieval.
* Ensure that your class behaves similarly to Python's built-in list.

### Task 2: NumPy Operations (`task2.py`)

This task introduces you to NumPy arrays and their operations. You will complete the NumPyArray class, which wraps around a NumPy array and provides various functionalities.

* Implement methods to return the shape of the array.
* Calculate the mean of the array without using np.mean.
* Implement element-wise multiplication and dot product operations.
* Ensure that all operations handle different shapes and edge cases properly

### Task 3: Data Processing with Pandas (`task3.py`)

In this task, you will work with a Pandas DataFrame to process student data. The StudentDataProcessor class helps clean and analyze student records.

* Fill missing values in the Age column with the median age.
* Drop rows where Math_Score is missing.
* Implement a method to return students who enrolled after a given date.
* Ensure the data is clean and ready for analysis.


## Submission

## Evaluation

## Notes

* Make sure your code is well-documented and readable.
* Test your implementations before submission to ensure correctness.
* If you're stuck, refer to the official Python, NumPy, and Pandas documentation.
