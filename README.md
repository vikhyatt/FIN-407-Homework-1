# Homework 1: FIN-407 (Machine Learning in Finance)

Welcome to Homework 1 of FIN-407! This assignment is designed to help you get comfortable with Python programming, NumPy, and Pandas, all of which are essential tools in Machine Learning for Finance.

## Overview

This repository contains two Python files: `task1.py` and `task2.py`. Each file presents a different challenge related to Python and its libraries. Your job is to complete the missing parts of the code marked with `# TODO`. This assignment will test your understanding of basic Python functionalities, NumPy operations, and data manipulation using Pandas.

## Tasks

### Task 1: NumPy Operations (`task2.py`) [30 points]

This task introduces you to NumPy arrays and their operations. You will complete the NumPyArray class, which wraps around a NumPy array and provides various functionalities.

### Task 2: Data Processing with Pandas (`task3.py`) [30 points]

In this task, you will work with a Pandas DataFrame to process student data. The StudentDataProcessor class helps clean and analyze student records.

## Getting Started

* Start by cloning this repository onto your local machine
* Download the required libraries on your Conda environment from the `requirements.txt` file in the repository as:
  
  `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Start Coding!

## Submission

For submitting the assignment, you need to complete the `.py` files make a new repository in the GitHub classroom. Then, you need to commit your completed files to this new repository. Make sure your code is free of any Compilation errors.

## Evaluation

The Homework will be evaluated based on the correctness of your solutions. We will be releasing some sample test cases so that you can check if your solution is working as intended. After submission, we would be running your code on Hidden (unseen) test cases. The grade of the assignment will be decided by the number of test cases your code passes.

## Notes

* Make sure your code is well-documented and readable.
* Test your implementations before submission to ensure correctness.
* If you're stuck, refer to the official Python, NumPy, and Pandas documentation.
